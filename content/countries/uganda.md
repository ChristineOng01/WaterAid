countryDesc: "Uganda has been growing in terms of population and the population tripled the global average. The access to sanitation and clean water facilities have decreased, because of the population size. Women and children especially are responsible for spending 36 hours a week carrying water over long distances, compromising their education and needs. One charity that supports the cause of the water system is Saferworld.
